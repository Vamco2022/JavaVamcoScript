This project only is a joke, maybe I'll update it untill the 2024 Jan. 12 (Maybe will still update it)

#How to use it

first, use "javac runClass.java" in cmd.
Then, write your code in Main.jvs (At .\file\code\).
Next, change the content of the program.inf (At .\file\).
the last, use "java runClass" in cmd.

#Help
